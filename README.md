## Why These Techniques Matter

Optimization algorithms are at the heart of machine learning, allowing for the efficient tuning of models to minimize error and improve predictions. This project focuses on direct and iterative methods to solve minimization problems, offering tools to handle a wide range of datasets and model complexities.

## Techniques Overview

- **Steepest Descent with Backtracking**: Adapts the step size for gradient descent, ensuring a sufficient decrease in function value.
- **Newton's Method**: Utilizes second-order information for faster convergence by approximating the objective with a second-degree Taylor series.
- **Least Squares Fitting**: Minimizes the sum of squared residuals to fit models to data, optimized via steepest descent or Newton's method.
- **Conjugate Gradient Method**: Solves linear systems with symmetric and positive-definite matrices efficiently, ideal for large-scale problems.
- **Fletcher-Reeves and Polak-Ribiere**: Adapt the Conjugate Gradient method for non-linear optimization, enhancing its applicability.

## Application in Machine Learning

These techniques optimize loss functions, manage high-dimensional data efficiently, and are broadly applicable, making them crucial for developing accurate and high-performing machine learning models.
